### Arithmetic Practice Game
It is a game for kids to practice basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Mine Sweeper
It is not like the real minesweeper game because it lacks the numbers that will appear around the bomb.  We just made this to master 2 Dimensional Arrays.

### Video Karera
A game where there is a car race with random winners.
